# Satellite_Calculations
Calculations related to earth-space radiowave propagation equations

These modules are based on equations found in text books on satellite communications and ITU-R P series regulations (https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P/en).

ITU-R software, data and validation examples are available at http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg3/Pages/iono-tropo-spheric.aspx

These modules are re-coded in python based on previous programs I wrote during PhD study into radiowave propagation in Matlab, IDL and C. 

Purpose is for self-learning of Python (which so seems to be very similar to MATLAB and IDL in any case).

All equations are openly published and I make no claims to be the author or have any ownership of the data used in their calculation. I have included references to equation source material. As these modules are coded directly from the source equations they are not based on the programs of other author as the objective was purely academic to application of Python. Where possible module outputs have been verited against web available examples.

Functions included are 
1. Satellite Elevation Angle (elv_deg)
